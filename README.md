## A\*Beginners API\*


</div>

### Description

This is for beginners who want to begin using API in order to manipulate other programs. This is VERY heavily commented (About a paragraph per line of code) and explains how to use API to manipulate other programs through several examples. Learn how to change a window's caption and send text to a textbox on a program (Notepad used in this example) and learn how to press buttons on a program (Calcualor used in this example) If you are a beginner and really serious about learning what the code actually means and how to understand the concepts than this is a great place to start. I wish somebody made something this detailed when I started... Don't forget to vote if you find this useful in anyway!
 
### More Info
 
Only tested in VB 6.0 and on Windows XP
